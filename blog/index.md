# Welcome

My name is Baile Burnsed, I am a self tought Developer and 
I am a High Functioning Austic Nerd, full discloser!

I love Tech, Sci Fi and all things FOSS!!!

This is my personal blog, where I will be covering my adventure of becoming a full stack developer.

I am always learning  know skills. Right now I am brushing up on the MEVN, MERN an MEAN tech stacks and I always using the LAMP Stack.

I am making Vlogs of my Projects and Daily Builds.
I like to automate boring tasks on my computer. I run a Linux box and I am learning
RHEL now and I configuring my I3 gaps config for more efficient use of my time.

I run a Debian based Linux distros, I also have used Arch and Manjaro, Really fun, but
not really good for production in my case.

The blog is made with VuePress and hosted on Firebase.

Please share my blog and Star my GitHub projects, Thank you for your time, have a good day.
