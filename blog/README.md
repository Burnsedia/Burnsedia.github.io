Welcome to My Blog,

This is my personal blog, where I will be covering my adventure of becoming
a full stack developer.

I am learning the MEVN(MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, Node.js), and the
MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) tech stacks and I already
am proficient at the LAMP Stack

I also will be making a Vlog of my Projects and Daily Builds,
I like to automate boring tasks on my computer. I run a Linux box and I am learning
RHEL now and I configuring my I3 gaps config for more efficient use of my time.

I run a Debian based Linux distros, I also have used Arch and Manjaro, Really fun, but
not really good for production in my case.

The blog is made with Jekyll and hosted on Firebase.

Please share my blog and Star my GitHub projects, Thank you for your time, have a good day.
