I am Bailey Burnsed, I am a Self Taught Software Developer and a College student, now studying Computer Science. I am a passionate programmer and I love to develop applications in the Flutter framework and the MEVN,  JAM and LAMP stacks for my applications. I also develop games in the Godot Game engine and use Firebase and Playfab for the game backends.
