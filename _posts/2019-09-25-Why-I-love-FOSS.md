#FOSS and Why you sould love it to

    If you are reading this blog and are wondering what I mean by FOSS, you probly don't know much about IP
property right laws and the legal ramifications when compies brack them, Amazon and Microsoft come to mind
when these things come up, in resent years Amazon has been braking the laws around the AGPL linsence and Microsoft constily for the past decade tryed to kill FOSS, claming that it was Canser, that is was bad. Only reason why they did that was to try to keep them from losing the server wars to US, FOSS nerds and Developers.
As you can amagin, We Won, mostly Microsoft has admided defeat and now uses FOSS on there Azure platform and Suports FOSS projects, like the Docker and Kubernutes projects and uses them in the Azure platform. 
Google supports and develops the same projects, thier employees actuly started these projects and are paying them full time to work on there passen projects. 

##What FOSS means
    FOSS means "Free" as in speech and "Open Source" software. Free as in speech means you can use the project for what ever perpus you want as long as you follow the license of the project. Open Source means you can see and use the software as long as you follow the license, and all the code you write for the project on your end is your code even if you contrute to the project. That is not even the best part, say you are using a FOSS tool, you own the IP of whatever you are making with the Tool, not the same with Propritary tools like the Adobe Sweet of tool, not even the art you make.

##Why you care
    You are the owner of the IP you make with FOSS tool you use, even the code of the project. You actaully own it. All of it!!!!
